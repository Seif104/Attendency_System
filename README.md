## Overview

The attendance management system is a web-based application that uses a camera to capture images of people entering and leaving a designated area, such as a classroom or office. The system then uses face recognition technology to identify the people in the images and mark their attendance status as present or absent.

The system provides a user-friendly interface for administrators to manage attendance records, generate reports, and view analytics.

The system is built using Python, a high-level programming language, and various open-source libraries and frameworks, including OpenCV for computer vision, and tkinter for GUI.

## Features

- Face recognition: the system uses OpenCV and Python to recognize people' faces and match them to a pre-trained dataset.
- Attendance tracking: the system tracks the attendance of each person in real-time and provides summary statistics for each one.
- Attendance report generation
- Search and filter attendance records by date or student/employee name
- Export attendance data to CSV format
- Real-time notifications for late arrivals or absences.
- Analytics and insights on attendance trends and patterns
- Easy to use: the system is designed to be user-friendly and does not require any specialized knowledge or training to operate.
